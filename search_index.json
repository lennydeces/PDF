You can use anything that Pandoc’s Markdown supports; for example, a math equation \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). 1.1 Usage Each bookdown chapter is an .Rmd file, and each .Rmd file can contain one (and only one) chapter. A chapter must start with a first-level heading: # A good chapter, and can contain one (and only one) first-level heading. Use second-level and higher headings within chapters like: ## A short section or ### An even shorter section. The index.Rmd file is required, and is also your first book chapter. It will be the homepage when you render the book. 1.2 Render book You can render the HTML version of this example book without changing anything: Find the Build pane in the RStudio IDE, and Click on Build Book, then select your output format, or select “All formats” if you’d like to use multiple formats from the same book source files. Or build the book from the R console: bookdown::render_book() To render this example to PDF as a bookdown::pdf_book, you’ll need to install XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): https://yihui.org/tinytex/. 1.3 Preview book As you work, you may start a local server to live preview this HTML book. This preview will update as you edit the book when you save individual .Rmd files. You can start the server in a work session by using the RStudio add-in “Preview book”, or from the R console: bookdown::serve_book() "],["helloworld.html", "Chapter 2 Note", " Chapter 2 Note .iframe-container { display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; /* Allow items to wrap to the next line */ justify-content: space-between; } .iframe-container iframe { width: 385px; /* Adjust the width as needed */ height: 500px; /* Adjust the height as needed */ margin-right: 10px; /* Add spacing by adjusting this value */ } .iframe-container .full-width { width: 780px; /* Make this iframe spread the full width */ height: 500px; /* Adjust the height as needed */ } Windows System➡️Display➡️Multiple displays➡️Detect other display➡️Detect→Buttons Right Click on File➡️Show more options Folder➡️Alt + Enter➡️Properties Folder➡️Ctrl + Shift + C➡️Copy as path Windows + P➡️Extend Windows + X➡️U➡️U Windows + Z Windows + Up Arrow | Right Arrow | Down Arrow | Left Arrow Adobe Acrobat View➡️Page Display➡️Two Page Scrolling Word Review➡️Tracking➡️All Markup➡️Drop Down➡️Simple Markup | All Markup | No Markup "],["welcome.html", "Chapter 3 Resource", " Chapter 3 Resource Application OPT and STEM OPT Timeline I-765 Application for Employment Authorization I-94 ICE Form I-983 E-Verify SEVP Portal | Student and Exchange Visitor Program Portal Ohio Findyourohio StreetLight TechCred Transportation Data Management System Urban Area Boundary Review Viewer Management Drawio ProcessOn Siyuan Timely Whimsical Xmind Survey Mentimeter Slido SurveyMonkey Paper Connected Papers EndNote Google Scholar Library Genesis MyBib ResearchGate ResearchRabbit Scidown Sci-Hub Web of Science Writing Copy.ai DeepL DocHero Grammarly MagicPen Paper Digest QuillBot Writefull Writesonic Zotero Design Canva Diagram Figma Galileo AI Logoai Looka Noya Uizard Drawing Adobe Firefly Booltool Clipdrop Dreamlike.art DreamUp Flaticon Hotpot.ai Hugging Face Jasper Lexica Midjourney Music Audo Studio AssemblyAI FakeYou LALAL.AI NaturalReader Resemble.AI Video DreamFace DeepBrain HeyGen Lumen5 Rephrase.ai Runway Synthesia Synthesys Plot Hiplot ImageGP Presentation Decktopus AI Powerpresent AI Coding Code Translator CodiumAI Productivity AI Chat Anthropic ChatBA ChatGPT Perplexity Poe Plagiarism Turnitin Cite This For Me "],["life.html", "Chapter 4 Life", " Chapter 4 Life ATAS and UGC is there to help you navigate your academic path.
